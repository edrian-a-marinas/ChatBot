sept 23 - 
extracting a data from functions. "{edrian, edri} = function();". [edrian, edri] = Promise.all
Modules Js. how to import and export 
await - wait for this to finish before running.
async await - waitng for data, but only where you tell to wait
promise.all([]) - runs at same time. wait all of them done. one fails whole fails
try {""} catch (error) 
backend (python) will fetch the data of an API, 
front end (JS) will fetch the data from backend, then he will display it to browser
request - post or get. to send a data to backend
response - server sends back to you.


sept 24:
__name__ == '__main__': 
  main() means is r run lng etong main function if the script is run  itself, pag na import to. eton main() is hindi gagana

extract in python from functions and class.   // edrian, panget = anosya(), edri = edri()
module / importing the whole module and the file from that module is different . import module and from module.__init__ import *

module.dog.mySize() - tinawag yung buong folder and dog.py to call the function mySize()
print(dogs.size) - pinrint yung dogs.size ng dogs class size | class.name - if vars lng taatawagin
dogs.greet() - tinawag yung function sa class dogs | class.greet() - if tawagin yung func sa greet

kung ano git add mo. ayun yung ma g git message 

__init__.py is unique. importing a module reads this first out of all. you cant rename this



sept 25:
always return values, dont return a string. if return blank you can just return 
Dictionary.py = myObject.Js
list.py = array.js
try and except exception as e . run tmie neto is pababa ng lines hindi na ittutuloy yung line error

class (other, class): is makukuha narin nya yan

__init__ in function is unique in clas. set up the object and declare the variable para ma connect mo sya sa ibang functions inside that class using self.

self is not unique, you can use other name like i as index. but self means "FOR THIS SPECIFIC OBJECT"
class means blueprint

self is para magamit mo yung initialized mo don sa ibang functions inside class

bank = Bank()  # ✅ Create bank once, keep all accounts inside it. the Bank() is just blueprint. bank is yung nalalagyan. so pag tinawag ulet sa main yung  bank = Bank() means may nagawa ulet na bagong bank That’s why if you keep calling Bank() again and again in your code, you keep creating new “empty banks” with no accounts saved inside.

Composition: "has a" relationship between classes. Example: My class Bank has an Account inside it. Bank contains Account → composition.

Inheritance: "is a" relationship between classes. Example: My class Dog is a class Animal. Class Dog (child) is dependent to Class Animal



sept 26:
inheritance = subBrand(Brand)  from Class Brand.
Composition = creatng a new brand inside the class like self.brand = brand (even tho may class nmn na na Brand.) means brand has. not is
Composition is always > Inheritance. always think if Composition if applicable. 
you can inherit a class in module. like InheritThis(module.classExample) This is used most of the time in django (models.Model)





oct 7:
Encapsulation:
example is public. safe go ahead. ex. name
_example is private. no python coded, just for devs to tell na mag double think kung gagamitin to.
__example is protected. ma a access mo lang tong variable na to inside the class and ma momodify. Stop internal use only protected

def example is public, safe to use directly outside class
def _example is private, make decision when you gonna use it. think twice always.
def __example is protected, only use this inside the class, modify it inside class. Internal use only for protection.

http://127.0.0.1:5500/reactPractice/react-basics.html #haha 2x

oct 22: 
react is external lib, that you can actually use any JS from other website if open sources
load the react library then use the .render (toDisplaythem) / print a like
JSX = same as JS, but can write HTML directly in jscode

Components = <ChatInput /> is a function
receives PROPS = ChatMessage({ message, sender }) // if ganto yung function, means nilabas mo na yung laman ng nasa function. example is properties dapat yan. prop.message and prop.sender. pag ganyan extracted na. Destructing, taking out of the object
passing PROPS is message={ChatMessage.message} children is connected to PROPS
children is the message in {ChatMessage.message} 

{sender === 'robot' && <img className="icon" src="../CSS/Images/robot.png" />} && is the if else statement of JSX and inside the return / HTML

function App () is almost the same as the def main in python. 
 


git status / check every file then -> dir .\reactPractice\CSS\ ->  type .\reactPractice\CSS\chatbot.css / para makita yung dinagdag -> git add



oct 24: 8:05 - 10:25
create a variable if needed. array const ChatMessages = [];. // kapag mag sasabi ka tas gusto mo i output.

array.map used in arrays, so you wouldnot modfiy the main array, to render todos, products, purpose is to transform each elemnt into an array magiging ChatValue Return => newValue

in django and react. use the {example} if using a variable inside JS and then putting it on HTML type

return
In Python & JS:  “return this result to whoever called me.” /python
In React: “return this UI structure so React knows what to render on the screen.” returns to react lib not to react ongoing code, then react lib will return it to html

function()
In Python & JS: function(parameter), In react: <function parameter="value" />


nov 11, 4:10 - 
PascalCase = function names
camelCase = variables

dont modifiy data directly. Always create a copy then modify the copy.

Hooks: // special react functionional component.
React.useState = lets a component store changing data and automatically update the UI whenever that data changes.



jan 6 - 
onChange - input value changes to run
onClick - Mouse click to run


const [inputText, setInputText] = React.useState(''); // bali inputText is sthe current value which is blank, then setInputText nmn is yung updated value




jan 7 - 8
State = data that is connected to HTMl
React.useState give 2 values, the current value and the value updater

Request
“Am I SENDING data to the server?” - if no "GET", if yes "POST"

GET - // backread old message, who clicked the button, or can i see this? or Give me data of this, what want to see, fetch the data / check order status // LOOKING - GET this from server
POST - // sending new messages, sending data like Name, Password. Sending the orders (data of it), want to enter, send data, pay bill, submit sensitive, big data, not searching // GIVING - Put this to server // never searchable in browser
response - // response/answers the requests from GET or POST, Can be data, can be success or error, after GET -> food is ready, after POST -> order placed success


request body - {
  "username": "edrian",
  "password": "mypassword123"
}
response body (from server):
{
  "message": "User edrian registered successfully"
}



HTTP Status codes: 
1xx - Request received / processing
2xx - Sucess 200 OK, 201 OK Created
3xx - Redirect 301 moved to new URL, 304 not modified
4xx - Client error. 400 Badreuqest, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not found.
5xx - Server error. 500 Internal server error

gagana lng yung POST sa postman if naka POST na yung sa code mo sa python


Server: Uvicorn can run python code and return, While python -m http.server 8000 is only http server for html, css and js only.

API - each URL end point is the API, example "http://127.0.0.1:8000/example"
"/" = homepage, Root URL, main, http://127.0.0.1:8000/
"/hello" = http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello - API

@app.get("/register") // every ganto isang API na agad nagawa, pwde na agad ma search

pydantic - Data validation library. for easy to see the errors
EmailStr - to locate error if the emailStr doesnt have @, BaseModel - early str, int in class. in @validator you can custom your what you want


Jan 9
CRUD = is POST GET PUT DELETE - HTTP Methods

Create -> POST -> Adding new to server (either client or admin)
Read -> GET -> retrieving or viewing data. (client)
Update -> PUT -> modifying existing data (admin)
Delete -> DELETE -> removing data (either client or admin)

stopped at #3 in tutorial, mag diretso na agad sa AI chatbot.












Special props/attributes
//State = data is connected to HTML, when data updated, it will update HTML
Event Handlers = run a function when interact with website. eg., onClick, onChange etc
key = gives each list item unique ID. ex. key={message.id}
className = adds css in react ex. classNam
crypto.randomUUID = unique id string
=======
































Phase 1: Basics / Fundamentals / Vanilla
Python, (Functions, Dict, Lists,  Loops, OOP,)
JS, (Functions, Arrays, Objects, ES6, Loops, Async )
HTML, (Links, Images, Forms etc.)
CSS,  (Transitions, etc.)
Git (Add, commit, push, pull etc.)
Linux (Basics command)
~Able to understand OOP, Functions, Arrays, Dict/Obj.


Phase 2: Focus front-end / LIBS
React.js (components, props, state, event handling, conditional rendering, List/keys, useEffect, async, fetch(HTTP request)) 
JSON (Objects, Arrays, Key-Value, Parsing/Stringify, Using with APIs, Etc.)
~ Basic exercise frontend (Calculator, Note, Darkmode etc,)


Phase 3:  Focus back-end / LIBS
Pandas, NumPy, scikitt-learn, Decorators
SQLalchemy -> CRUD ->  PostgreSQL
~  Basic exercise backend (CLI Stock Price Predictor, Statistical Analysis & Visualization )


Phase 4: Focus backend frameworks: 
Django-REST (models, admin, settings, views, urls, forms, algrorithm, template, decorators, request Library etc) - no website
FastApi (endpoints, request handling, decorators) - no website
~  data handling, and internal framework


Phase 5:  Full stack  integration / learn how full stack works frontend + backend / talk to api
HTTP Basics – Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes, headers
REST API (understand how frontend <-> backend works together)
APIS (POST-man (public, other APIS, learn to test and inspect APIs))
JWT Tokens
WebSockets, 
pytest, jest
~ backend handles requests → data is processed by Python libs → response sent to frontend or API client. data visualization react fetches api/json from python. Test is using postman and pytest to test APIS and endpoints


Phase 6: Choose 1 project to start with. / apply all learned
FastApi or Django  + React.JS + PostgreSQL
software design/ architecture / MVC Pattern / Algorithm / SDLC
~The project should runs locally and no bugs. test it too


Phase 7: Host the projects, PaaS.
Docker
Render 
Create a porfolio about the projects finished
~ FULL-STACK DEV -back-end-focus-
