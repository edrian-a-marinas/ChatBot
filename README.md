## ⚠️ About Response Speed

You might notice that the AI takes a bit longer to respond in the demo video.  

This is because the chatbot runs entirely **locally** on my laptop, which has **entry-level specs** (CPU-Intel i3 1005G1 , GPU-NVIDIA MX330 , RAM-8GB).  

Thank you for your patience, and I hope you still enjoy chatting with Edrian’s AI! 🤖
